BASM include files are essentially a list of constant names followed by their values.

32 byte header starting with:
`db "BASM3.0 INCLUDE",0`
The rest of that header can be used for a description or such.

27*2 byte letter jump table to the file offset of each sequence of constants starting with the letter
Ex. `dw 55 ;tbl_A`

constant and value entries must be in all caps.
entry example:
```
db "USERMEM",0,3
dl EXD1A881
```

There is also a second kind of value, which essentially pastes code into your program from the include file.
The relocations table is necessary to move the addresses used here from their offset in the code into the offset of your program.
The following example is written in BASM assembly source.
```
entry:
	db "ZERO HLU",0,EXFF
	dw .len,.reloLen
.relocations:
	dw .a1,.a2
.reloLen:-.relocations
ORIGIN 0
	ld (.temp),hl
.a1:-3
	xor a,a
	ld (.temp+2),a
.a2:-3
	jr .endcode
.temp:
	dl 0
.endcode:
.len:-entry
origin Ï€POP
```
